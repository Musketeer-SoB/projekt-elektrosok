# projekt-elektrosok
Repository for controlling electric collar as a IOT device. Meant for using electroshocks as a productivity device, like e.g. a smart alarm

Currently, I just mashed together two repos.
I took the mDNS, webserver and API implementation from https://github.com/bdsm-spuddy/esp8266-shockduino
But I really liked the byte sequence construction and transmission from https://github.com/CrashOverride85/collar (Type 1)

So it's currently a frankenstein monster that I stitched together a year ago. 

I will do something original with this, I swear. I am new to this, and I just need a shock alarm ASAP.
